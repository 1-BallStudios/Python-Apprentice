Since Pythagoras, we know that {math}`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.

```{math}
:label: mymath
(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

(a + b)^2  &=  (a + b)(a + b) \\
           &=  a^2 + 2ab + b^2
```

The equation {eq}`mymath` is a quadratic equation.

Alternately: 

$$
(a + b)^2  &=  (a + b)(a + b) \\
           &=  a^2 + 2ab + b^2
$$ (mymath2)

The equation {eq}`mymath2` is also a quadratic equation.
